This is a simple installer for Ubuntu 22 or new releases.

There is no building or compiling, so you can deploy within a minute.

Non-free feeatures or cutting edge gstreamer fixes may be missing, but publish.py should still work if you are running a recent version of Ubuntu with this installer.

Hardware encoding/decoding support may be missing, but if you are running this on a desktop/laptop, that shouldn't be an issue.
